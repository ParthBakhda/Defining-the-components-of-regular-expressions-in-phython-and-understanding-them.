- What did you learn? I learned the different terms and their meaning also how to examplify regex.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. First I had to research the different terms and try to find exmaples of regex, then I had to create introduction and summary and started to define the terms. Once terms were defined I had to create examples of regex and how to use them. Upon completion I finished the author section and linked my github.
