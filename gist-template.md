# Title Defining the components of regular expressions in phython and understanding them.

Introductory paragraph:Hello everyone, my name is Parth Bakhda, Regular expressions also known as (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation in programming. In this tutorial, we will explore various components of regular expressions in Python. I hope you will spend educating yourself and learning the components. I did spend some time researching these titles.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will explain various components of regular expressions and how they can be used in Python. Also I will provide code snippets to illustrate each concept. We will cover topics such as anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matching, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead/look-behind assertions. Please press control (Ctrl) on keyboard and click on the table of contents titles to be referred to their definition and examples of their regex. Thank you.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are symbols used to match a specific position in a string. The ^ symbol represents the start of a line, and the $ symbol represents the end of a line. For example, the regex ^Welcome will match any line that starts with "Welcome," while Universe$ will match any line that ends with "Universe."

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers represent the number of occurrences of a character or a group in a regex pattern. The * symbol matches zero or more occurrences, + matches one or more occurrences, ? matches zero or one occurrence, and {n} matches exactly n occurrences. For example, the regex b+ will match one or more consecutive "b" characters.

### OR Operator

The OR operator (|) allows you to match either one pattern or another. For example, the regex mouse|cat will match either "mouse" or "cat" in a string.

### Character Classes

Character classes allow you to define a set of characters to match. For example, [aeiou] will match any vowel, and [0-9] will match any digit.

### Flags

Flags are optional parameters that can be added to a regex pattern to modify its behavior. They are used to control case sensitivity, multiline matching, and other options. For example, the re.IGNORECASE flag can be used to perform a case-insensitive search.

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping allows you to treat multiple characters as a single unit. Parentheses ( ) are used to create groups. Capturing groups also store the matched value for later use. For example, the regex (cd)+ will match one or more occurrences of the sequence "cd."

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are used to define a set of characters within square brackets [ ]. They allow you to match any single character from the defined set. For example, [def] will match either "d," "e," or "f."

### Greedy and Lazy Match

By default, regular expressions are greedy, meaning they match as much as possible. However, you can make them lazy by adding a ? after a quantifier. This makes the regex match as little as possible. For example, the regex b+? will match the smallest possible sequence of "b" characters.

### Boundaries

Boundaries are used to match specific positions in a string without consuming any characters. The \b symbol represents a word boundary, and \B represents a non-word boundary. For example, the regex \bcat\b will match the word "cat" but not "cats" or "scat."

### Back-references

Back-references allow you to refer back to previously captured groups in a regex pattern. They are noted by \ followed by the group number. For example, the regex (\w+)\s+\1 will match a repeated word.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and look-behind assertions allow you to match a pattern only if it is followed or preceded by another pattern, without including the lookahead/lookbehind in the match. Look-ahead is noted by (?=...), while look-behind is noted by (?<=...) or (?<!...). For example, the regex (?<=@)\w+ will match a word that follows the "@" symbol.
